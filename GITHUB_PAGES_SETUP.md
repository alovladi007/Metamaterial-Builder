# 🌐 GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## ✅ Files are Ready!
Your GitHub Pages files have been successfully pushed to the repository.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup:

### 1. Go to Your Repository Settings
Visit: https://github.com/alovladi007/Metamaterial-Builder/settings/pages

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages

In the **Build and deployment** section:

1. **Source**: Select `Deploy from a branch`
2. **Branch**: Select `main`
3. **Folder**: Select either:
   - `/root` (to use index.html)
   - `/docs` (to use docs/index.html)
4. Click **Save**

### 3. Wait for Deployment
- GitHub Pages takes 2-10 minutes to build and deploy
- You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready

### 4. Access Your Site

Your site will be available at:
```
https://alovladi007.github.io/Metamaterial-Builder/
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### If the page doesn't load:
1. Check if GitHub Pages is enabled in settings
2. Wait a few more minutes (first deployment can take up to 10 minutes)
3. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check the Actions tab for build status

### If you see a 404:
1. Make sure you selected the correct branch (main) and folder
2. Verify the files exist by visiting:
   - https://github.com/alovladi007/Metamaterial-Builder/blob/main/index.html
   - https://github.com/alovladi007/Metamaterial-Builder/blob/main/docs/index.html

## 📱 What the GitHub Pages Site Shows:

The GitHub Pages site is a **landing page** that:
- Explains this is a full-stack application
- Provides installation instructions
- Shows the technology stack
- Links to the repository
- Gives deployment options

## 🚀 Remember:

**GitHub Pages can only host static HTML/CSS/JS files.**

Your Metamaterials Research Lab application is a full-stack app with:
- FastAPI backend (Python)
- Next.js frontend (React)
- Database operations
- Real-time simulations

These require servers to run and **cannot run on GitHub Pages**.

To actually use the application, users must:
1. Clone your repository
2. Run it locally with Docker or manual setup
3. Or deploy to a cloud platform (Vercel, Render, Railway, etc.)

## ✅ Current Status:

- Repository: https://github.com/alovladi007/Metamaterial-Builder ✅
- Code: Successfully pushed to main branch ✅
- GitHub Pages files: Added at root and /docs ✅
- You just need to enable GitHub Pages in settings!
